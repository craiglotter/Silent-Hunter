Silent Hunter

The rise in illegal P2P applications on the UCT network is cause for alarm, especially when students start abusing the lab machines for their own purposes. Silent Hunter is an application that has been written to run in the background on a lab machine and kill any recognisable P2P application instance should it be started up. 

Processes are stopped by checking running process names against a wishlist of processes to be killed.

Silent Hunter also logs all kills with the Commerce webserver, attempting to log time of instance, current Novell user, the process killed, the machine's primary IP and MAC addresses as well as the machine's name.

Note: To avoid detection, Silent Hunter frequently changes it's launch name.
